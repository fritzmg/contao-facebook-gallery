Contao Facebook Gallery
===================

Simple extension to allow the integration of a Facebook album via a gallery content element. 

### Notes

* Due to a lack of implementation within the Graph API of Facebook, public albums from Facebook groups cannot be displayed.
* Currently, the images are always linked directly from Facebook and will not be cached locally.
* The Facebook Graph API data is cached locally and can be purged in the system maintenance.
